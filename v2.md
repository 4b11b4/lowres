Content
=
In a 4-year Bachelor's electrical engineering<br>
college curriculum, you are mostly taught theory.

Additionally, most (around half) of the theory<br>
will **not** be used on a daily basis
(unless you move into an advanced field).

Theory of one concept alone is obviously<br>
not a "well-rounded education".

At the end of it all, you have a good enough working knowledge and can
"join the workforce".

--

The result is an imbalance of knowledge.

Of the *teacher*:<br>
If the goal of an education is to enable the student to
achieve anything the student desires, then
it is not enough to "teach" about a specific technical field.
The content chosen by the teacher is always changing over time
and dependent on the students.

Of the *student*:<br>
If the goal of an education is to enable oneself to
achieve your own dreams, then an education must
cover a wide range of knowledge
otherwise the scope of those dreams is to be limited.

--

This content is for this 2-month pilot program is based on the idea that teaching a  
pair together in such a way that they are both more easily understood.

The two ideas are:
**sound** (vibration) and **electrical engineering**

pair together in such a way<br>
that they naturally increase understanding of the other.

**Note:** I have planned material for a first "session".
<br>This may spill over into two or three days. 

Overview
-

1. What is sound?
   * Go around the circle and everyone give their defintion of sound.
2. Listen: sound clips (nature, animals, instruments)<br>
   and view the sounds in **real-time**:
   * sound wave from oscilloscope
   * frequency graph from spectral analysis
      * use an equalizer ("EQ") to tune in and out certain sounds<br>
        with your own two hands<br>
        and watch them change on the two devices above
3. Play
   * instruments, turntables, drum machine, analog synthesizers
4. Record
5. Listen to our recordings, and:
   * sound from the drum machine, analog synthesizers
   * sound from a song recording -- identify different instruments from the
     shape of the waveform
6. What is sound?
   * What is your definition of sound, now? 
1. What is music?
   * How do you define music?
3. Play
4. Record
7. Listen
3. Introduction of each **path**
5. More playing between introductions of paths

<h3>Paths</h3>

1. Neuroscience
   * How does the ear pick up vibrations in the air and then
translate these vibes into an electrical signal for the brain?
   * Everyone hears differently. Do a sound test to see who can hear the
     highest and lowest pitch sounds.
2. Physics
   * How does sound travel through the air (and what is the math that
     describes it)?
   * Does sound exist without air?
3. Amplifiers
   * How do you make a speaker cone vibrate?
4. Speaker Cabs 
   * How does a box influence how speaker a sounds?
   * Build one out of wood or design a model and 3D print it.
5. Radio
   * How does electricity shoot off into the air...?
   * Build an FM radio kit.
6. Recording
   * Learn how to capture sound.
7. Energy 
   * Build a solar panel and make it charge a car battery.
8. Electrical Engineering Theory
   * Double A batteries are 1.5 volts. What is a volt?
   * What does the math look like for describing how many electrons flow?
9. Turntables
   * Manipulate a record.
10. Drum Machine
    * Create a drum loop.

Session Two
-
For the second session, there are a handful paths we can take.<br>
It is possible we explore more than one path at the same time.<br>
I have purposefully _not_ planned past session one because<br>
any plans would likely change.

Equipment
=
<p align="left">
  <img src="./img/serato.jpg" alt="Serato" height="200">
  <img src="./img/spectral.jpeg" alt="Spectral" height="200">
</p>

1. Oscilloscope: shows the shape of a sound wave
2. Spectral Analysis: shows the loudness of certain frequencies (or, "pitches")
3. Drum Machine: to create digital drum kits and patterns 
4. Turntables
5. Analog Synthesizers: electric circuits for creating sounds
5. Instruments: piano, guitar, drums, Native flute, uke, an electric keyboard
- misc: soldering iron, breaboards, electronic part library,
3D printer, table saw, skill saw, scrap wood, solar panel,
FM radio kits, amplifiers, subwoofer, mixers, microphone

Funding
=
If funding is available, it would be used towards:
* food: We will start off every day with food in the morning.
* supplies: I have most of the equipment already, but there are a few things which
            would help<br>
            depending on the paths we take.

Afterthoughts
=
The curriculum "<b>Low Resistance</b>" is a play-on-words.

The coil of wire in a speaker --- [ a long string of copper wire wrapped around in a circle ] ---<br>
This coil --- has some natural "<b>resistance</b>" to electricity flowing through it.

<img src="./img/parts_of_a_speaker.jpg" alt="Speaker Parts" height="220"/>

"<b>Low</b> resistance" suggests the curriculum is<br>
opposite<br>
highly inflexible, "<b>high</b> resistance" curriculum found in<br>
educational settings.

What are the motivations for this class?<br>
As I grow older, it is obvious to me --- in trying to learn... <ins><b>anything</ins>:</b><br>
having a **mentor** and without is like **day** and night.

Without a mentor, you must wander in the dark<br>
and use your <b>will</b> to find some <b>light</b>.<br>
You can move **faster** when<br>
someone is lifting you back up<br>
and helping you back to **running** after each fall.

When I remember back, the only mentors I had when I was young<br>
--- at least, for a <ins>long period</ins> of time ---<br>
were my parents.<br>
I wonder how my life may have been shaped.

**...again...** why bother with this class?<br>
Before you are old -- is when tutors and mentors make the big differences.<br>
There are a few areas in which I can be a tutor or a mentor.<br>
