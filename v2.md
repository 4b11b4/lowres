Summary
=
This document describes<br>
the plans for a 2 month pilot of a<br>
project-based summer school<br>
for high school students.


Content
=
This content is primarily based on my own "educational background"<br>
and equipment that I have acquired over the years.

In this class,<br>
introductory college-level **electrical engineering** concepts<br>
are paired together with:
* **sound** (basic physics, brain interpretation)
* **music** (creation, recording, theory, history)
* **speakers, amplifiers** (construction, repair)
* **lighting** (additional parallels to frequency)

These concepts together are mutually beneficial.

Electrical engineering is an "abstract" concept because<br>
you have to hold it in your mind.<br>

It's unlike mechanical or civil engineering,<br>
where you can see with your eyes what is being built.<br>
The flow of electricity cannot be observed by the eye.

Pairing with these additional concepts<br>
provides a real-life parallel to<br>
something which is usually only thought of in the mind,<br>
and allows for it to be heard by the ear and seen by the eye,<br>
making it much easier to grasp.

1. Oscilloscope: shows the shape of a sound wave
2. Spectral Analysis: shows the loudness of certain frequencies (or, "pitches")
3. Drum Machine: to create digital drum kits and patterns 
4. Turntables
5. Analog Synthesizers: electric circuits for creating sounds
5. Instruments: piano, guitar, drums, Native flute, uke, an electric keyboard
- misc: soldering iron, breaboards, electronic part library,
3D printer, table saw, skill saw, scrap wood, solar panel,
FM radio kits, amplifiers, subwoofer, mixers, microphone

**Note:** I have planned material for a first "session".
<br>This may spill over into two or three days. 

Overview
-

1. What is sound?
   * Go around the circle and everyone give their defintion of sound.
2. Listen: sound clips (nature, animals, instruments)<br>
   and view the sounds in **real-time**:
   * sound wave from oscilloscope
   * frequency graph from spectral analysis
      * use an equalizer ("EQ") to tune in and out certain sounds<br>
        with your own two hands<br>
        and watch them change on the two devices above
3. Play
   * instruments, turntables, drum machine, analog synthesizers
4. Record
5. Listen to our recordings, and:
   * sound from the drum machine, analog synthesizers
   * sound from a song recording -- identify different instruments from the
     shape of the waveform
6. What is sound?
   * What is your definition of sound, now? 
1. What is music?
   * How do you define music?
3. Play
4. Record
7. Listen
3. Introduction of each **path**
5. More playing between introductions of paths

<h3>Paths</h3>

1. Neuroscience
   * How does the ear pick up vibrations in the air and then
translate these vibes into an electrical signal for the brain?
   * Everyone hears differently. Do a sound test to see who can hear the
     highest and lowest pitch sounds.
2. Physics
   * How does sound travel through the air (and what is the math that
     describes it)?
   * Does sound exist without air?
3. Amplifiers
   * How do you make a speaker cone vibrate?
4. Speaker Cabs 
   * How does a box influence how speaker a sounds?
   * Build one out of wood or design a model and 3D print it.
5. Radio
   * How does electricity shoot off into the air...?
   * Build an FM radio kit.
6. Recording
   * Learn how to capture sound.
7. Energy 
   * Build a solar panel and make it charge a car battery.
8. Electrical Engineering Theory
   * Double A batteries are 1.5 volts. What is a volt?
   * What does the math look like for describing how many electrons flow?
9. Turntables
   * Manipulate a record.
10. Drum Machine
    * Create a drum loop.

Session Two
-
For the second session, there are a handful paths we can take.<br>
It is possible we explore more than one path at the same time.<br>
I have purposefully _not_ planned past session one because<br>
any plans would likely change.

Assumptions

Afterthoughts
=
The curriculum "<b>Low Resistance</b>" is a play-on-words.

The coil of wire in a speaker --- [ a long string of copper wire wrapped around in a circle ] ---<br>
This coil --- has some natural "<b>resistance</b>" to electricity flowing through it.

<img src="./img/parts_of_a_speaker.jpg" alt="Speaker Parts" height="220"/>

"<b>Low</b> resistance" suggests the curriculum is<br>
opposite<br>
highly inflexible, "<b>high</b> resistance" curriculum found in<br>
educational settings.

What are the motivations for this class?<br>
As I grow older, it is obvious to me --- in trying to learn... <ins><b>anything</ins>:</b><br>
having a **mentor** and without is like **day** and night.

Without a mentor, you must wander in the dark<br>
and use your <b>will</b> to find some <b>light</b>.<br>
You can move **faster** when<br>
someone is lifting you back up<br>
and helping you back to **running** after each fall.

When I remember back, the only mentors I had when I was young<br>
--- at least, for a <ins>long period</ins> of time ---<br>
were my parents.<br>
I wonder how my life may have been shaped.

--

**...again...** why bother with this class?<br>
Before you are old -- is when tutors and mentors make the big differences.<br>
There are a few areas in which I can be a tutor or a mentor.<br>

-- 

In a 4-year Bachelor's electrical engineering<br>
college curriculum, you are mostly taught theory.

Additionally, most of the theory (roughly... half)<br>
will **not** be used on a daily basis<br>
(unless you move into an advanced field).

Theory of one concept alone is obviously<br>
not a "well-rounded education".

At the end of it all,<br>
you have an good enough theoretical knowledge and<br>
little experience of how it applies to the real world,<br>
but you are ready to<br>
"join the workforce".

--

The result is an imbalance of knowledge.

Of the *teacher*:<br>
If the goal of an education is to enable the student to<br>
achieve anything the student desires, then<br>
it is not enough to "teach" about a specific technical field.<br>
The content chosen by the teacher is always changing over time<br>
and dependent on the students.

Of the *student*:<br>
If the goal of an education is to enable oneself to<br>
achieve your own dreams, then an education must<br>
cover a wide range of knowledge<br>
otherwise the scope of those dreams is to be limited<br>.
