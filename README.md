## Foreword <a name="foreword"></a>
"Low Resistance" is a play-on-words. A speaker coil's "resistance" determines
how much electricity flows through it. The word resistance has multiple
meanings. In this case, "low resistance" might suggest the curriculum is
opposite the
highly inflexible, or, "high resistance curriculum" found in most
"educational" settings in the US in 2019.

Why bother with this class?<br>
The answer: the younger you are, the more valuable a tutor is.

The only _long-term_ tutors when I was young were my parents. Who knows how my
life would have been shaped.<br>
As I get older and am trying to learn
new things, the value of a tutor is blindingly obvious.<br>
I can learn something by myself, but it will be slow.<br>
I can move a lot faster
when someone is getting me back running after each fall.

_**Again, why?**_<br>
Everyone learns a lot faster with someone else's help.<br>
There are a few areas in which I can be a tutor.

## Content <a name="content"></a>
This class is based on the idea that two concepts pair together in a way which 
helps understanding of the other:<br>
**sound** and **electrical engineering**.

## Equipment <a name="equipment"></a>
Currently available:

1. Oscilloscope: shows the shape of a sound wave
2. Spectral Analysis: shows the loudness of specific frequencies
(or, "pitches") in the audible human range
3. Drum Machine: to create digital drum kits and patterns 
4. Turntables
5. Analog Synthesizers: electric circuits for creating sounds
5. Instruments: piano, guitar, drums, Native flute, uke, keyboard
- misc: soldering iron, breaboards, electronic part library,
3D printer, table saw, skill saw, scrap wood, solar panel,
FM radio kits, amplifiers, subwoofer, mixers

## Session One <a name="session_one"></a>
**Note:** I have planned curriculum for one "session". This may spill over
into two or three days.

For the second session, there are a few paths to take.<br>
Noting that the "low resistance", or, flexibility of the curriculum is
determined by the class, it is ineffective to plan prior to knowing the class.

### Session One Curriculum 
0. What is music?
   * Everyone give their defintion of music.
1. What is sound?
   * Everyone give their defintion of sound.
2. Listen to sound clips
   * Listen to a variety of sound clips from nature, animals,
and instruments while viewing in real-time:
      * sound wave from oscilloscope
      * frequency graph from spectral analysis
3. Play: instruments, turntables, drum machine, analog synthesizers
3. Introduction to each **path**


#### Paths
1. Neuroscience
   * An introduction to how the ear picks up vibrations in the air and
translates the vibrations into an electrical signal for the brain.
   * Everyone hears differently. Do a sound test to see who can hear the
     highest and lowest pitch sounds.
2. Physics
   * An introduction to how sound travels through the air and the math that
     governs it.
3. Amplifiers
   * An introduction in creating circuits that move speaker cones back and
     forth.
   * Build a basic amplifier circuit for a small speaker.
4. Speaker Cabinets
   * An introduction to creating a box that influences how speaker sounds.
   * Build a subwoofer box.
   * 3D print a speaker enclosure.
5. Radio
   * An introduction to how electricity shoots off into the air.
   * Build an FM radio kit.
6. Recording
   * Learn the basics of recording sound.
7. Energy 
   * Build a solar panel and make it charge a car battery.
