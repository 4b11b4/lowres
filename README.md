## Foreword <a name="foreword"></a>
"Low Resistance", when talking about curriculum, is just a play-on-words.<br>
In the coil of a speaker, the long length of wire wrapped around a magnet,<br>
has some amount of "resistance",<br>
which determines how many electrons can flow.

In this case, "low resistance" might suggest the curriculum is
opposite<br>
the highly inflexible, "high resistance curriculum" found in most<br>
"educational" settings in the US in 2019.

What are the motivations for this class?<br>
One answer is obvious as I am older.<br>
In learning anything, having a **mentor** and without is like **day** and night.<br>
Without a mentor, you are in the dark wandering until you find some **light**.<br>
Of course, you **will** find the light, but it will be much slower.<br>
You can move a lot **faster** when someone is getting you back **running** after each fall.

When I remember back, the only mentors I had when I was young -- for a 
<ins>long period of time</ins> --<br>
were my parents. I wonder how my life would have been different. 

**...again, why?**<br>
Everyone figures it out a lot faster with someone who has already been down the path.<br>
When you are young -- is when tutors and mentors make the big differences.<br>
There are a few areas in which I can be a tutor or a mentor.<br>



## Content <a name="content"></a>
This class is based on the idea that two concepts pair together<br>
in a way which one helps understanding of the other:<br>
**sound** and **electrical engineering**.


## Equipment <a name="equipment"></a>
Currently have access to:

1. Oscilloscope: shows the shape of a sound wave
2. Spectral Analysis: shows the loudness of specific frequencies
(or, "pitches") in the audible human range
3. Drum Machine: to create digital drum kits and patterns 
4. Turntables
5. Analog Synthesizers: electric circuits for creating sounds
5. Instruments: piano, guitar, drums, Native flute, uke, keyboard
- misc: soldering iron, breaboards, electronic part library,
3D printer, table saw, skill saw, scrap wood, solar panel,
FM radio kits, amplifiers, subwoofer, mixers, microphone

## Session One: Sound <a name="session_one"></a>
**Note:** I have planned curriculum for a first "session".
<br>This may spill over into two or three days. 

### Overview 
1. What is sound?
   * Everyone give their defintion of sound.
2. Listen: various sound clips (nature, animals, instruments)<br>
   and view the sounds in **real-time**:
   * sound wave from oscilloscope
   * frequency graph from spectral analysis
      * use an equalizer ("EQ") to tune in and out certain sounds<br>
        with your own two hands<br>
        and watch them change on the two devices above
3. Play: various instruments, turntables, drum machine, analog synthesizers
4. Record: record some sounds from above
5. Listen: to our recordings, and more sounds:
   * sound from drum machine, analog synthesizers
   * sound from a music recording -- and identify different instruments from the
     shape of the waveform
6. What is sound?
   * Everyone give their defintion of sound, again.
3. Play
4. Record
3. Introduction of each **path**

#### Paths
1. Neuroscience
   * An introduction to how the ear picks up vibrations in the air and
translates the vibrations into an electrical signal for the brain.
   * Everyone hears differently. Do a sound test to see who can hear the
     highest and lowest pitch sounds.
2. Physics
   * An introduction to how sound travels through the air and the math that
     describes it.
   * Does sound exist without air?
3. Amplifiers
   * An introduction in creating circuits that move speakers back and
     forth.
   * Build a basic amplifier circuit for a small speaker.
4. Speaker Boxes 
   * An introduction to creating a box that influences how speaker sounds.
   * Build a small speaker cabinet or 3D print a speaker enclosure.
5. Radio
   * An introduction to how electricity shoots off into the air.
   * Build an FM radio kit.
6. Recording
   * Learn how to properly capture sound.
7. Energy 
   * Build a solar panel and make it charge a car battery.
8. Electrical Engineering Theory
   * Double A batteries are 1.5 volts. What is a volt?
   * What does the math look like for describing how many electrons flow?
9. Turntables
   * Learning how to match two records to the same speed and mix them.
10. Drum Machine
    * The basics of how to create a drum loop.

## Session Two
For the second session, there are a handful paths we can take.<br>
It is possible we explore two paths at the same time.
